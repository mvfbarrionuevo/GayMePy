For many years I've been trying to make something of my life, well after all I'm almost getting my PhD done and realized that I should have done more. Thus, as an ordinary gay man lost in a country that is constantly trying to kill me for my sexual orientation I wonder what still holds me back? Well, let Nina Simone sing this for you: 

<p class="message">
  Ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
  Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
  Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
  Ain't got no wear, ain't got no job
  Ain't got no money, no place to stay
</p>

Well, despite having some friends - good ones - and having get such a high education degree as a PhD I still without money, place to live, job and the list goes on. I'm not trying to make fun of any of those issues, or being sarcastic, nor dramatic. But let face the true. Who am I? Did you know me? Have you ever heard about me? I bet the answer is a flatter no, and that's ok. What I'm trying to say is that I'm by no means special, sugar coated person. However, I'm a person like you, who needs to pay the bills, have some food and survive. Well, survive from anyone who is trying to kill you because you are, ahnmm, you are ... well, you know. Gay.

So, yeah. That's it. I'm a human being, gay, poor, English is my fourth language (so please be kind to my grammar mistakes), and it happens to me that I like to do scientific stuff out there, mostly related to computational chemistry - or spooky programming stuff (yeah that's a bad joke). This blog is about it, is about being human, face the life's challenges - particularly if you live in a developing country, a conservative and opressive one that hates you. Welcome to this humble page, where I will try to present things that I like, and bring some discussions to the table.

Please, let me help to spread the word of science, love, humanity and kindness and let me know anything that I can't do for your, perhaps we could schedule a talk through Zoom or Google Meet, we could change emails, send letters, gifts, chocolates, a cake recipe or a scientific partnership :), who knows?

Well, if you want to know more about me, perhaps there are a few ways to do so. One is to [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BarrionuevoMVF) or [sending me an email](manoelvfb@gmail.com).
